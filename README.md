# piCamera-on-Ingelborough
A Raspberry pi camera pointed at Ingelborough

This is code running on a raspberry pi 2 with the latest version of Raspian - 2018-06-27-raspbian-stretch
with a picamera attached. 

It starts a preview, pauses for 6 seconds to adjust for light then takes the picture. It adds the date and time to the picture and also rotates it. 

Upcoming: tweet a picture in a response to a tweet
